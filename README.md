# Coding challenges from [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com)!

Welcome to my challenges i've done by learning `C#` on [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com).

## Branches?
Each `branch` is an code challenge that i ended successfully.

## Working code?
Sometimes it can be, that some methods in the code are related to [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com) server build-in's so
read the `README.md` in the given branch and check out if i added a working code to compile by yourself =)

## Where you find the code and readme?
In the main branch you will find a directory, this is called like the challenge itself e.g `xxxxChallenge`, so in this directory you will find the code and a special README.md.  
Working code is written in the file `program_working.cs` if i had to use code that is related to [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com) otherwise `program.cs` can be compiled and run by yourself =)  
Just check `README.md` of an challenge to get notice about related code by [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).
